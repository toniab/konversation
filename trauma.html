            <p class="dark">[1] when i cry, sadly it's for you.</p>

            <p class="dark">dream days of art, you showed me what art is. i was a little duckling following your lines made through snow and leaves for the perfect photo. the world didn't know beauty like i knew yours and how you saw it. we painted and broke tiles in the garage for a mosaic table with a salted glaze. i can't look at it too long without remembering how much i miss your grace. i saw you cry once, then we had a tender bedtime tuck in. life seemed effortless and pleasantly small. not knowing how easy it was till it wasn't.</p>

            <p class="dark">i wasn't supposed to, but i overheard the moment that taught me struggle. nothing in this world could eat you up, but it was cancer that found a way how. i played dumb until i realized it was the last night i would see you in your tommy hilfiger / ralph lauren ensemble. i kept my eyes on book 3 of the harry potter series while you said goodbye at the door. i glanced up for a quick goodbye, then back to reading.</p>

            <p class="dark">fuck harry potter.</p>

            <p class="dark">i ran to your 11 day warm hospital bedside. barely out of a coma and into drugged oblivion, i tried to revive you with saturday morning cartoons. remember how much we loved those? two days later and i heard the news after school in a home full of wailing aunts. i did the only hollywood thing i knew how to do- lock myself in my room, cry and not let anyone in. i didn't believe i lost you until people asked me about you. i avoid that soft spot in my heart because it's you, and i want to keep you in the most impenetrable part of me.</p>

            <p class="dark">who would you be today? are you proud of me? what's it like where you are? are you?</p>

            <p class="dark">mama put my sister and i in the middle of the fabric of our lives with your photographs, wrapped us all up, we took off hoping to start again.</p>

            <p class="dark">we moved to be by another ocean. when i cry though, it tastes like the atlantic.</p>
            
            <p class="med">[2] when identity fucks you over.</p>

            <p class="med">i saw something i couldn't unsee, tucked it in a walnut shell and swallowed it. it hurt at first. my esophagus became very weak after that. i did it though. i forgot the secret nugget in my gut for two years. one day it sprouted roots. it took months of growing pains to remember what i left there.</p>

            <p class="med">thoughts of she.</p>

            <p class="med">no easy way to tell a lover i'm still harboring taboos in my belly. it wasn't a discreet transition. my walnut was getting heavy with new life, and the thought of suppressing it further felt terrible. i left everything i knew for everything i didn't, and there i was robbed at identity point. public insults and private insults that became public later.</p>

            <p class="med">i was alone with my secret, saved only by a kind soul willing to walk with me down the crooked path. the walk was short, but eventually the training wheels broke off. they say i still have heartwheels though.</p> 

            <p class="med">that's the truth.</p>

            <p class="med">i found a new home, cultivated new soil and eventually vomited the walnut into the earth.</p> 

            <p class="med">green leaves poke out the soil and some of them still twist the way they used to, just a little stronger for having more directional sense of the sun.</p>

            <p class="light">[3] when it all seems so clear, don't want it to be.</p>

            <p class="light">over enthusiasm felt mildly sarcastic, as if to hide anger. don't want to. want to just forget and have a good                                       night. swallowed stress feeling hurt so ill it was scary. felt barraged, was panicking. wanted to just leave and try to salvage the night, but  grabbed my arm and pulled me back into the car. scratched in two places&hellip;wouldn't believe or recognize- me, a liar and untrustworthy.</p>

            <p class="light">so helpless the constant yelling no saving from the public witnesses. felt humiliated, asked to stop. jabbed in the chest 4 times. stop being rough and getting physical. shoved into a crowd of people.</p>

            <p class="light">beyond stunned. it went that far. walked backwards and shoved against a wall. head hit the wall just running out sobbing down the street and sobbed on the sidewalk like hiding, afraid. offered me money to take a cab home rescue me wandering downtown, not knowing what to do, cash phone and blanket tears.</p>

            <p class="light">beyond stunned feel broken, disconnected, jarred, traumatized. a complete reckless state of being felt unsafe don't know what to feel right now&hellip;regretful ? violated hurt so deep can't understand what's up just down. domestic violence is stripped so utterly alone and broken, a monster that night, mourn that loss.</p>

            <p class="light">make the pain mean something makes me want to be ugly nobody will want me. this whole time, sang the song of                     change.</p>

            <p class="light">in a daze. walking around a world in limbo. empty and still pour and heave into tissues and thoughts of should haves. instinct would have served well.</p>

            <p class="light">is it all just surviving?</p>

           <p class="light"> an atom bomb went off.</p>

           <p class="light"> is there anything even left?</p>
