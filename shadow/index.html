<h5>I.</h5>
<p class="text">Nestled between the borders of two negligent worlds is an an unmapped valley, populated only by shadows.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>
<p class="text">I sometimes manifest as a hazy, nebulous thing in a place of sharp angles. Other times I am a lump of coagulated honey studded with bee stings, messily interrupting the placid order of a soft space. No matter my shape, I am only a moving dimness levitating slightly with unrealized and unspent energy, floating aimlessly.</p>

<h5>III.</h5>
<ul><li>"Who am I?"</li>
<li>"Where do I belong?"</li>
<li>"Who are my ancestors?"</li></ul>

<p class="text">More smoke than sound, the words barely echo in the depths of the valley. I'm still begging for the answers to these questions. I can't do much else but haunt these shadowy fields, each step crushing the star bright white flowers of forgetfulness and trampling the dainty rosey berries of hatefulness.</p>

<h5>IV.</h5>
<p class="text">I am seafoam waiting to become flesh, half born and wholly unwanted. Perpetually met with  cringes and sighs, a cruel magic that dissolves the tender half body I built up into a pool of murky water. I am hovering between realities without being able to settle comfortably into either. Lingering on the periphery eternally. Constantly craving phantoms that never existed. Tormented by what could have been and what I am not. Yearning for rest. Praying for a true home. I am exhausted. I tire of swallowing sorrow and gulping down grief, yet still starving.</p>

<h5>V.</h5>
<p class="text">Compulsively and continuously gathering up as much of myself as I can. Writing down self definitions and filing them away under the roots of a pomegranate tree. Manifesting myself with the everyday magic of arranging words. I live in my loneliness, exchanging electric shocks with the other flickering shadows who glide past me in this liminality. My touch turns things to ash but I still sup upon these small particles of reality, blessed by their bygone beauty.</p>

<p class="text">What I am, at this point in time, according to myself :
<ul><li>a fig eating beast</li>
<li>a living breathing rose</li>
<li>a seafoam serpent</li>
<li>a gelatinous quince seed</li>
<li>a pillar of flames</li>
<li>a dying star</li>
<li>a feral garden</li></ul></p>
