        there is so much i could say and so much that was left unsaid here. i can't be there for you and tell you it anymore. it pains me i had to find you words this way. i wish you could see the confusion you caused. all these people that flooded out of the woodwork for you. there was only love and it was all for you. if only you could hear every little story and witness every little moment and see how every single day since march has been a heartache. maybe it would have changed your mind but maybe not. this is what i missed. i missed you writing here. i missed it in the blackhole of the internet where everything is proposed to strangers and resolved by strangers. people will never know you weren't resolved. i'm trying to understand. this page is a tiny indicator of what i missed, what we all did. i won't ever stop feeling that.</textarea>

            The Ampersand is a broken variation of the Infiniti. "And" implies separate entities to join. Infiniti implies constant continuation with no distinct lines between end and begining. Your hand. The table. All just an extension of the story of the universe.<br /><br />

            There is no "you"<br />
            "You" are a coincidental manifestation of the aftermath of an exploding star in a universe that will continue after "you".<br /><br />
            "You"<br />
       A temporal vestige.<br /><br />
