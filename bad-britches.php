    <p>
    hey so<br />
    i just finished this poem last night, im no writer really<br />
    it's not that great, didn't have much time to finish<br />
    haven't really been on a stage in a while<br />
    and i don't really know how to read it<br />
    because
    </p>
    <p>
    it's a sloppy mess of mechanical mindworks<br />
    un-inspired and nonsensical<br />
    i can't believe<br />
    i wrote this in an hour
    </p>
    <p>
    to call myself a writer leaves a taste on my tongue so sour<br />
    it reverse-big-bangs y mouth<br />
    back into a single,<br />
    ugly<br />
    point in my mouth,<br />
    i can't talk.
        </p>
        <p>
    no-tongue leaves lips quivering around<br />
    jumping teeth and glazed gums,<br />
    no<br />
    i'm not that nervous<br />
    but it may seem that way.
    </p>
    <p>
    it might seem i don't do poetry proper,<br />
    paper hands speaking much softer,<br />
    having trouble turning trouble<br />
    into choreographed authors, they
    </p>
    <p>
    write bruised biographies.
    </p>
    <p>
    but this is not about my jagged politics<br />
    unfortunate violences <br />
    or reclamation.<br />
    i don't want your conflict, gender this,<br />
    fuck that.<br />
    you shouldn't have to jerk <br />
    to the rhythm of my tensions and<br />
    disputes in order to be moved by my<br />
    words.
    </p>
    <p>
    i don't want to have to make you cry<br />
    for you to make a sound, a verbal cue<br />
    that this message moves you.
    </p>
    <p>
    i'd sooner hiccup over a laugh track<br />
    looped into my line breaks.<br />
    but i don't have the steady hands<br />
    to cross-stich digital sounds<br />
    into sampled paper.
    </p>
    <p>
    i just shake paper handshakes,<br />
    receptacles of collective nerves<br />
    that travelled from brain to fingerprints<br />
    in hopes of relaying the message that<br />
    my mind<br />
    is <br />
    fucking<br />
    cluttered,<br />
    pack-ratted and hoarded<br />
    i need a purge...
    </p>
    <p>
    so i wrote this
    </p>
    <p>
    but i'm not a writer
    </p>
    <p>
    so i never started.
    </p>
