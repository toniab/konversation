        <p>I had to learn the straight path to God by the age of seven. I imagined heaven something like having a golden ticket to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. That one room with the tiny door in it- an illusion as to how to get to the other side. Today, I realize that golden ticket rests purely on luck and consuming tons of chocolate.</p>
        
        <p>Isn't gluttony a sin? And lady luck is probably some sexy ass sinner as well. I was totally illuded by the whole fantasy. 18 years later, my straight path to God is...more colorful than a trajectory. Small basement raves with doors leading to the illusion of a smoking patio, when really it's just another room full of sweaty bodies. Eating flowers, binging on red vines, getting stoked on chocolate fountains at gay weddings.</p>
        
        <p>Coming to face with the straight path and the thresholds we must cross to get there, the work is so deep it plummets us back into forgetting through anti-establishment means. We as in me and my sister. The black sheep. We had to dig our own canals.</p>
        
        <p>I sat on Bart after a long day learning about contemporary art in the Persian diaspora. Next to me sits an Afghani family as I pull out a collection of Iranian-American essays. They quickly shift from farsi to pashto- my father's native tongue and one I still understand. They have three daughters wearing pink, blue, and purple car coats with monochromatic ensembles. I felt their gaze squeezing my path straight- tightened up my scarf and body language into a ball of good behavior. My passageway from Earth to the beyond is molded by my constant identity and faith struggles. My passageway is cluttered with trinkets, photographs, estate sale finds- stories of other people. I'm trying to find the thread that is me.</p>
        
        <p>18 years into the future, my mind just might abandon me for a clean hallway with no doors. For now, I'll make the clutter worth it.</p>
