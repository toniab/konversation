    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, we were looking for a space where we were forced to exercise our creative abilities.
    Every two weeks, we choose a theme and produce a graphic or literary piece engaging that theme.
    We produce our pieces isolated from each other, but present them in konversation on this site.
    To us the meaning of our work is not static or absolute, even if our work is derived from a specific intention.
    Re-presenting our pieces in konversation allows us to re-experience our own work.
    As artists we understand the konversation surrounding the meaning of a piece doesn't end at the completion of a work.
    The konversation is not only between us, but all those who choose to participate in their own unique experience of it.

    Since then, we have expanded our virtual art gallery by incorporating featured guests into our exhibitions. In doing so, we hope to foster experimentation in style, difference in perspective, and community between artists. Contact us for further inquiry.
